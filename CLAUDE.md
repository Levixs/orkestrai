# Svelar App — Agent Guidelines

## Required Flow

- Follow the Svelar architecture: route -> controller/page action -> FormRequest/shared schema validation -> DTO -> action/service -> repository -> model/resource -> response.
- Use Svelar CLI generators before hand-writing artifacts when a generator exists.
- Use Svelar ORM and migrations. Avoid raw SQL unless it is a low-level driver/infrastructure exception.
- Keep one migration per table or focused schema change.
- Use shared schemas for backend validation and frontend forms. Use Superforms where app forms need shared validation.
- Keep validation consistent with `svelar.validation.json`. Use Zod schemas in Zod apps and Valibot schemas in Valibot apps.
- Use policies, permissions, teams, middleware, rate limits, sessions, jobs, events, listeners, observers, cache, storage, search, PDF, and broadcasting through Svelar APIs instead of ad hoc implementations.

## Imports

- Prefer app aliases such as `$lib/modules/...`, `$lib/domain/models/shared/...`, `$lib/database/...`, and `$lib/factories/...`.
- Prefer Svelar subpath imports such as `@beeblock/svelar/orm`, `@beeblock/svelar/routing`, `@beeblock/svelar/forms`, `@beeblock/svelar/validation`, `@beeblock/svelar/auth`, `@beeblock/svelar/queue`, and `@beeblock/svelar/storage`.

## Frontend

- Use Svelte 5 runes in `.svelte` files: `$props`, `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, and `{@render children()}`.
- Do not use Svelte runes in plain `.ts` files.
- Use generated shadcn-svelte components for app UI.
- Mutating browser `fetch` calls must include Svelar's CSRF header. Enhanced forms can use the regular form flow.

## Verification

- Before shipping meaningful changes, run focused tests and `npm run build` when feasible.
- For queue or scheduler behavior, run `npm run dev:worker` and `npm run dev:scheduler` locally with Redis available.
- Do not revert unrelated user changes in the working tree.
